# Rez

Rez is an agentic execution & intelligence layer for perpetual derivatives. We are building a non‑custodial platform & infra where on‑chain agents autonomously manage perps with 0 manual commands.

## What is Rez?

Unlike traditional algorithmic bots that rely on static, hard-coded rules, Rez leverages **Neuro-Symbolic AI**. It uses "symbolic" technical indicators (EMA, RSI, MACD) as tools, which its "neural" brain (LLM) interprets to form a market thesis.

### Key Philosophy: Radical Abstraction

Rez is designed to abstract away the complexities of DeFi trading. Instead of managing individual orders and API rate limits manually, users interact with Rez via high-level **Risk Profiles**. Rez handles the underlying execution, risk management, and market analysis autonomously.

## Core Pillars

1.  **Autonomous Intelligence**: Uses a ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) loop to dynamically fetch data and validate entry/exit points.
2.  **Hyperliquid Integration**: Optimized specifically for the Hyperliquid L1, taking advantage of its high throughput and native perpetuals.
3.  **Local Alpha**: Calculates technical indicators locally to ensure maximum precision and minimize dependence on external processing services.
4.  **Transparent Reasoning**: Every trade decision is backed by a verbose reasoning chain, viewable in real-time via the companion dashboard.
