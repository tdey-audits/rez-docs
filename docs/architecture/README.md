# System Overview

Rez is designed as an asynchronous, event-driven trading system. It operates in a continuous loop, orchestrating data between exchange APIs, local computational engines, and remote Large Language Models.

## High-Level Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the primary components and the flow of data during a single trading cycle.

## Core Component Responsibilities

### ⚙️ Main Control Loop (`src/main.py`)
The "heartbeat" of the system. It manages the execution timing (intervals), error handling, and orchestrates the transition between state synchronization, decision making, and execution.

### 🧠 Decision Agent (`src/agent/`)
The reasoning engine. It takes the structured market context and uses LLMs to generate trade theses. It specifically manages the multi-turn tool-calling loop to ensure high-confluence decisions.

### 📊 Indicator Engine (`src/indicators/`)
The computational layer. It fetches raw candle data from Binance and uses `pandas-ta` to calculate technical indicators locally. This ensures that the agent always works with mathematically accurate, non-lagging data.

### 💸 Trading Engine (`src/trading/`)
The interface to the Hyperliquid exchange. It handles authentication, signing of transactions, and manages the placement of both market orders and secondary trigger orders (Take-Profit/Stop-Loss).

### 🖥️ Monitoring Dashboard (`frontend/`)
A real-time visualization layer that consumes the backend's `diary.jsonl` to display PnL tracker, active positions, and the agent's internal reasoning logs.

## The Execution Cycle

A typical cycle follows this sequence:
1.  **Sync**: Fetch account balance and current positions from Hyperliquid.
2.  **Ingest**: Pull latest OHLCV candles for tracked assets.
3.  **Calculate**: Generate EMA, RSI, and Volatility metrics locally.
4.  **Reason**: Dispatch metrics to the LLM; handle any recursive tool calls.
5.  **Execute**: Place market orders based on the decision.
6.  **Secure**: Immediately attach TP/SL trigger orders to the newly opened positions.

## Technology Stack

*   **Runtime**: Python 3.12+ (Backend), Node.js (Frontend)
*   **Frameworks**: `aiohttp` (API), Next.js 15 (Dashboard), Tailwind CSS 4
*   **Libraries**: `hyperliquid-python-sdk`, `pandas-ta`, `pydantic`
*   **AI**: OpenRouter (Unified Interface for GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
